      <h2 class="subheading">What is global warming?</h2>
      <p>
        As we know, global warming describes the current rise in the average 
        temperature of Earth's air and oceans. So it relates closely to climate 
        change, because the result is the climate change. The weather has become 
        very extreme. We have terrible storms and heat waves. But whether is there 
        a solution to this problem at all? I want to share my thoughts on this now 
        with you in this little blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion, climate change would be reversible, if people would deal 
        with it much more. I mean that each person should be do something little 
        every single day. Perhaps, select the rubbish, or don't buy more plastic, 
        but if we think about it, we can do many more little things in our personal 
        life. We just need to start right now.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        Naturally, it's also our personal decision, so we have to make a decision 
        yet today. If we wait for a long time it can be possible that it will 
        be late. I have tried to examine why people don't want to step. What is 
        the most important in their life and why? I have given these questions 
        to many people, from my friends to unfamiliar people around me. I have 
        tried to find out why is it so hard to do anything in this subject? 
        The answer has been in the most cases that "I don't believe in the climate 
        change." or "I don't have time for doing anything. I am very busy every day."
      </p>

        If you get these same questions what is your answer for them? Please 
        share your opinion about this article, I would love to get to know your 
        personal viewpoint. What do you think, will we able to change our thinking? 
        Can planting trees solve this problem? Do you have time for changings or 
        you are also very busy as others? What is the most important in your life? 
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        According to me, we still can do many things to change the situation. First
        of all, we can protect our surroundings from too much waste, then we can 
        plant trees as a volunteer. If we don't kill too many animals and we reinstall 
        them back we can rescue the animal world from extinction. But the most important 
        is the time. We need to act right now! We cannot wait more! If we do something 
        yet today, we will have a beautiful future in this place, but if don't, we will 
        extinction, as other species and we can tell then: That was our responibility.
        Is it sure that we really want this? 
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        I don't want to live a place like seeing below. But it is imaginable 
        that we will have a habitat like this in the future. We will not have 
        enough drinking water, and food, and the weather will be too hot and dry. We will 
        not able to live in this kind of world. That's why, the question is very 
        essential: Why don't we do something? The Earth is yours too.

            <h1 class="title">Renewable energy</h1>
            <p>
              According to another approach, renewable energy is the other important 
              part of the changings. If we use this, we can save a lot of energies for 
              long term, and later much money, and we can protect our environment. 
              What do you think? Do you agree? Tell me, would you use that?
